#X text 14 9 [attenuate~] simulates the inverse distance law \, which
states that the sound pressure from a spherical sound source in a free
field decays linearly with the distance from the sound source. The
same law is better known in a version that is known as the inverse
square laqw \, which states that the /acoustic intensity/ decays with
the /square/ of the distance. For our purposes \, however \, the first
version of the law is more convenient \, because gain factors in Pd
(i.e. \, numbers between 0 and 1 that we multiply signals with) correspond
to sound pressure \, not acoustic intensity.;
