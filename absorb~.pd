#X text 9 11 [absorb~] simulates the loss of high frequencies for increasing
distances between a sound source and a listener. It uses a low-pass
filter whose cutoff frequency decays from 20kHz by 1kHz per 10m of
distance. This decay rate has been derived empirically rather than
from actual physics.;
