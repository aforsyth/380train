#X text 22 25 [whistle~] is a model of a steam whistle based on white
noise source that is subjected to a series of harmonically tuned bandpass
filters. The model is based on the observation that a steam whistle
\, like a flute \, behaves as a pipe open at both ends and therefore
produces all harmonics f1*N. The whistle blows whenever it receives
a [bang( at its inlet.;
